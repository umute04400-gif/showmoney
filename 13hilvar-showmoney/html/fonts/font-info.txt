Font Information:
================

This folder should contain the Gala Condensed Medium font file.

To use this money display system properly, you need to:

1. Download the Gala Condensed Medium font
2. Convert it to WOFF2 format (for web compatibility)
3. Place the file as 'GalaCondensed-Medium.woff2' in this folder

Alternative fonts that work well if Gala Condensed is not available:
- Arial Narrow
- Oswald
- Roboto Condensed

The CSS will fallback to these fonts automatically if the primary font is not found.
